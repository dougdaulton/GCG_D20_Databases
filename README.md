# d20 Databases

**d20-databases** is an expanding set of open-source tools and datasets written in Python that leverage generative AI and structured data to support the creation, conversion, and publication of *Adventure Paths*, campaigns, monsters, spells, and more across a wide range of D20 tabletop roleplaying game systems.

The project began with the excellent work of the [`5e-database`](https://github.com/bagelbits/5e-database) and aims to broaden its scope to include content from systems like **Pathfinder 1E and 2E**, **D&D 1st through 5th Edition**, and emerging open ecosystems such as those licensed under **ORC**, **Creative Commons**, or **GCL** (Game Content License).  

All data will include structured metadata for **license type**, **data provenance**, and **usage rights**, ensuring respectful treatment of intellectual property, including attribution and license complianceâ€”without use of protected trade dress or proprietary content.

## ðŸ“š System Databases (Planned and In Progress)

This repository is designed as a hub for interoperable databases across D20 systems:

- [x] **D&D 5th Edition (SRD-based)** â€” Original 5e-database  
- [ ] **D&D 5E+** â€” For post-2024/OneD&D public materials  
- [ ] **D&D 3rd Edition**  
- [ ] **D&D 3.5 Edition**  
- [ ] **D&D 4th Edition**  
- [ ] **D&D 2nd Edition (AD&D)**  
- [ ] **D&D 1st Edition (OD&D / BECMI)**  
- [ ] **Pathfinder 1st Edition** *(Placeholder: PyZO Pathfinder 1E)*  
- [ ] **Pathfinder 2nd Edition** *(Placeholder: PyZO Pathfinder 2E)*  

Each database will eventually include normalized schemas and conversion tools for monsters, spells, classes, feats, items, and moreâ€”enabling remixing and publication under compatible license frameworks.

## ðŸš€ How to Run

### With Docker

You can build and run the 5E database locally using Docker:

docker run ghcr.io/5e-bits/5e-database:latest

## How to run

### With Docker

You should be able to build locally and then run the local Docker image. This can be done one of two ways:

1. If you just need an image and you aren't running an M1:

```bash
docker run ghcr.io/5e-bits/5e-database:latest
```

2. If you're running an M1 or you want to test changes that you've made to the Database:

```bash
docker build -t 5e-database .
docker run -i -t 5e-database:latest
```

### Without Docker

First you need to make sure you have [MongoDB installed locally.](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/)

You can load this data locally by running:

```bash
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost/5e-database npm run db:refresh
```
